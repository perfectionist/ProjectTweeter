## Resources ##

### iOS Programming ###
* [iOS SDK Programming](http://pragprog.com/book/adios/ios-sdk-development) by Chris Adamson and Bill Dudney.
        This is an excellent book with uptodate iOS 5 examples.  It uses ARC and storyboards by default.
* [iOS Programming, the Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 2nd Ed](http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/ios_programming_the_big_nerd_ranch_guide_nd_edition_)

### Xcode ###
* [Xcode 4 videos](http://pragmaticstudio.com/screencast-tags/xcode4) **FREE**. These
    provide a great introduction to key and advanced features of Xcode 4. 

### Objective-C 2 Programming ###
* [Objective-C Programming](http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-bdobjc/coding-in-objective-c-2-0) Pragmatic Programmer videos are a very good introduction.
* [Programming in Objective-C 2.0, 2nd Edition](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Programming-in-ObjectiveC-20/9780321566157.page) by Stephen G. Kochan is a excellent reference but does not really cover the idoms and best practices.
